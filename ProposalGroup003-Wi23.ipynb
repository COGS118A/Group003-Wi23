    "# Abstract \n",
    "As time progresses, scientists and civilians alike are growing concerned by the increased frequency of earthquakes. Since earthquakes are a product of built-up tension between tectonic plates, they are often described as hard to predict. However, we believe utilizing what we have learned about supervised learning in combination with past earthquake data will help us magnitude of future earthquakes. This project aims to predict the magnitude of future earthquakes using machine learning techniques; we will use linear regression, regression decision trees, and feedforward neural networks. The dataset utilized is a public dataset from Kaggle that contains significant earthquakes from 1965-2016. We trained these models to describe our earthquake features in relation to the magnitude and predict magnitudes of future earthquakes, ultimately providing us insights into the relationship between earthquake features and magnitudes. This will help us prevent future earthquakes-related catastrophes. "

You can do that through HTML footnotes (demonstrated here). I used to reccommend Markdown footnotes (google is your friend) because they are simpler but recently I have had some problems with them working for me whereas HTML ones always work so far. So use the method that works for you, but do use inline citations.\n",

    "There are over 23,000 data points with 21 different variables.\n",

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "After receiving feedback from instructors, we decided it would be best to predict only the magnitude of future earthquakes utilizing three models: a linear regression, a regression tree, and a neural network. We chose not to predict other features as the models we studied in class equip us to predict one feature per model. \n",
    "In order to better visualize where earthquakes occur, we converted the longitude and latitude coordinates featured in our dataset into grid locations (analogous to a chess board). We would graph the earthquakes on this grid and utilize the grid coordinate as one of our features. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since magnitudes are an integral in interpreting the danger of earthquakes and are continuous numerical values, we chose to use linear regression; it has the ability to accurately model relationships and predict continuous numerical values. In this case, the features of our model would be the grid coordinate, depth, and azimuthal gap. Using these, we will predict the magnitude as our data point. In order to test the accuracy of this model, we will use mean squared error.  \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, we plan on using a regression decision tree. This model is similar to linear regression. Its only difference is that it uses decision partitioning to make its regression. The variables we’ll feed into the decision tree will stay the same as the previous model. Each of these will act as a split for the model. A regression decision tree model is appropriate for our project as it’s good for predicting a singular numerical value. We will then use cross validation to check the accuracy of our model’s results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, after researching, we decided to use feedforward neural networks featured in PyTorch as our neural network model. Since predicting magnitude is a regression based problem and our data is tabular in nature a feedforward neural network works best. We do not need to use a CNN as they’re typically used for image processing or data with spatial relationships. RNNs are off the table as they aren’t applicable to tabular data. Again, the features remain the same as the previous models. Since the size of our dataset is big, we aim to create a model using 40-50% of our dataset. We will train our neural network and fit it to our split dataset. To validate the accuracy of our neural network, we will calculate the loss/error for our batches of data and use functions similar to those within discussion lab eight to calculate the final accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "To first clean our data, we will utilize Pandas. To create the aforementioned grid coordinates and graph our data, we will need to import Matplotlib and Seaborn. In addition, given that we mainly utilize regression models, we will need to import Numpy, Scikit-Learn, and PyTorch (and the necessary functions and libraries). All these in conjunction with one another will help us predict the magnitude of future earthquakes and validate the accuracy of our predictions. We will finalize on n whichever model produces the highest accuracy. \n",
